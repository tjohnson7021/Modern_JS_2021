/*
* CODING CHALLENGE # 3
*/

// There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!

// Your tasks:
// 1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
// 2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that as well (draw means they have the same average score).

// 3. Bonus 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a score of at least 100 points. Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum score, as well as multiple else-if blocks ðŸ˜‰.

// 4. Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100 points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy.

// Test data:
// Â§ Data 1: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110.

let dolphinsScoreAvg = (96 + 108 + 89)/3; 
let koalasScoreAvg = (88 + 91 + 110)/3; 

if(dolphinsScoreAvg > koalasScoreAvg){
  console.log(`The Dolphins win the trophy.`)
} else if (dolphinsScoreAvg === koalasScoreAvg){
  console.log(`It is a draw!.`)
} else {
  console.log(`The Koalas win the trophy.`)
}

// Â§ Data Bonus 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123.


dolphinsScoreAvg = (97 + 112 + 101)/3; 
koalasScoreAvg = (109 + 95 + 123)/3; 

if(dolphinsScoreAvg > koalasScoreAvg && dolphinsScoreAvg >= 100){
  console.log(`The Dolphins win the trophy.`)
} else if (koalasScoreAvg > dolphinsScoreAvg && koalasScoreAvg >=100){
  console.log(`The Koalas win the trophy.`)
} else {
  console.log(`It is a draw!.`)
}


// Â§ Data Bonus 2: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 106.

dolphinsScoreAvg = (97 + 112 + 101)/3; 
koalasScoreAvg = (109 + 95 + 106)/3; 

if(dolphinsScoreAvg > koalasScoreAvg && dolphinsScoreAvg >= 100){
  console.log(`The Dolphins win the trophy.`)
} else if (koalasScoreAvg > dolphinsScoreAvg && koalasScoreAvg >=100){
  console.log(`The Koalas win the trophy.`)
} else if (koalasScoreAvg === dolphinsScoreAvg && koalasScoreAvg >= 100){
  console.log(`Both win the trophy!`)
} else {
  console.log(`No one wins the trophy.`)
}
