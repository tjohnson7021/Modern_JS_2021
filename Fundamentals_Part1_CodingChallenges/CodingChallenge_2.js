/*
* CODING CHALLENGE # 2
*/

// Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it.

// Your tasks:
// 1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
// 2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs . Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
// Hint: Use an if/else statement ðŸ˜‰

let markMass;
let johnMass;
let markHeight;
let johnHeight;

johnMass = 92;

const markBMI = markMass/markHeight ** 2
